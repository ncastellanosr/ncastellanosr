## Hi there 👋

My name is Nicolás. I am a System´s Engineering student at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, currently at the sixth semester.
At this point, I know many things but I am an expert in none of them. The things I know include:
- Full Stack Web Development
- Desktop Application Programming
- Game Programming

I am looking foward learning low level programming and scientifical computing. Aside from this, I have interests in music.
